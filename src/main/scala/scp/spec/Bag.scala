/**
  * The default implementation of Bag, geared towards easy debugging rather than efficiency
  * It will consistently and deterministically throw exceptions for contract violations
  * 
  * Implementation
  * Main approaches
  *   - [relocating] on remove, fill up with last elem and reduce size -- but update reference! (or reference table?)
  *     would probably work by Ref's being mutable objects
  *   - on remove, add freed index to a free list
  *   - on remove, shift all elements (pretty bad -- but could be amortized if use several buffers?)
  *     need to keep a table of index offsets (not sure feasible)
  * 
  * Note that for actual specialized versions, the relocating approach will probably become worst as values become big if we have SOA optim
