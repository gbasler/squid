# **Squid** ― Scala Quoted DSLs

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/epfldata-squid/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/epfldata-squid/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/epfldata-squid/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)



## Introduction

**Squid** (for the approximative contraction of **Sc**ala **Qu**ot**ed** **D**SLs)
is a **metaprogramming** framework 
that facilitates the **type-safe** manipulation of **Scala programs**.
Squid is geared towards
the implementation of **library-defined optimizations** [[2]](#gpce17) and 
helps with the compilation of **Domain-Specific Languages** (DSL) embedded in Scala [[1]](#scala17).
In addition, it uses **advanced static typing** techniques to prevent common metaprogramming errors [[3]](#popl18).

<!-- TODO: give concrete application examples to pique curiosity/generate interest -->

**Caution:** Squid is still experimental, and the interfaces it exposes may change in the future. This applies especially to the semi-internal interfaces used to implement intermediate representation backends (the `Base` trait and derived).


<a name="early-example">

## A Short Example

To give a quick taste of Squid's capabilities,
here is a very basic example of program manipulation.
The full source code can be [found here, in the example folder](/example/src/main/scala/example/doc/IntroExample.scala).

Assume we define some library function `foo` as below:

```scala
@embed object Test {
  @phase('MyPhase) // phase specification helps with mechanized inlining
  def foo[T](xs: List[T]) = xs.head
}
```

The `@embed` annotation allows Squid to the see the method implementations inside an object or class, so that they can be inlined later automatically (as shown below) 
–– note that this annotation is _not_ required when we just want to use these methods in a quasiquote!

What follows is an example REPL session demonstrating some program manipulation
using Squid quasiquotes, 
transformers and first-class term rewriting:

```scala
// Syntax `code"t"` represents term `t` in some specified intermediate representation
> val pgrm0 = code"Test.foo(1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Nil) + 1"
pgrm0: Code[Double] = code"""
  val x_0 = Test.foo[scala.Int](scala.collection.immutable.Nil.::[scala.Int](3).::[scala.Int](2).::[scala.Int](1));
  x_0.+(1).toDouble
"""
// ^ triple-quotation """ is for multi-line strings

// `Lowering('P)` builds a transformer that inlines all functions marked with phase `P`
// Here we inline `Test.foo`, which is annotated at phase `'MyPhase`
> val pgrm1 = pgrm0 transformWith (new Lowering('MyPhase) with BottomUpTransformer)
pgrm1: Code[Double] = code"scala.collection.immutable.Nil.::[scala.Int](3).::[scala.Int](2).::[scala.Int](1).head.+(1).toDouble"

// Next, we perform a fixed-point rewriting to partially-evaluate
// the statically-known parts of our program:
> val pgrm2 = pgrm1 fix_rewrite {
    case code"($xs:List[$t]).::($x).head" => x
    case code"(${Const(n)}:Int) + (${Const(m)}:Int)" => Const(n+m)
  }
pgrm2: Code[Double] = code"2.toDouble"

// Finally, let's runtime-compile and evaluate that program!
> pgrm2.compile
res0: Double = 2.0
```

Naturally, this simple REPL session can be generalized into a proper domain-specific compiler that will work on any input program 
(for example, see the stream fusion compiler [[2]](#gpce17)).

It is then possible to turn this into a static program optimizer,
so that writing the following expression expands at compile time into just `println(2)`:

```scala
MyOptimizer.optimize{ println(Test.foo(1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Nil) + 1) }
```

We can also make this into a proper [Squid macro](#smacros),
an alternative to the current Scala-reflection macros.


## Installation

Squid currently supports Scala versions `2.11.3` to `2.11.11`
(more recent versions might work as well, but have not yet been tested).

The project is not yet published on Maven, 
so in order to use it you'll have to clone this repository
and publish Squid locally,
which can be done by executing the script in `bin/publishLocal.sh`.

In your project, add the following to your `build.sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "ch.epfl.data" %% "squid" % "0.2-SNAPSHOT"
```

Some features related to [library-defined optimizations](#qsr) and [squid macros](#smacros), 
such as `@embed` and `@macroDef`, 
require the use of the [macro-paradise](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/paradise.html)  plugin.
To use these features, add the following to your `build.sbt`:

```scala
val paradiseVersion = "2.1.0"

autoCompilerPlugins := true

addCompilerPlugin("org.scalamacros" % "paradise" % paradiseVersion cross CrossVersion.full)
```


## Overview of Features


### Squid Quasiquotes

Quasiquotes are the primitive tool that Squid provides to manipulate program fragments 
–– building, composing and decomposing them.
Quasiquotes are central to most aspects of program transformation in Squid.

**Note:** in our POPL paper [[3]](popl18), we refer to code types as `Code[T,C]`; in the actual implementation presented here, these types are written `IR[T,C]` 
(and `Code[T]` is used for non-contextual code types).

#### Type-Safe Code Manipulation

Unlike the standard [Scala Reflection quasiquotes](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/quasiquotes/intro.html),
Squid quasiquotes are statically-typed and hygienic, 
ensuring that manipulated programs remain well-typed 
and that variable bindings and other symbols do not get mixed up.
Squid quasiquotes focus on expressions (not definitions), but Squid provides way to _embed_ arbitrary class and object definitions so that their methods can be inlined at any point (or even automatically).


#### Flavors of Quasiquotes

Two forms of quasiquotes co-exist in Squid:

 * **Simple Quasiquotes [(tutorial)](/doc/tuto/Quasiquotes.md)** provide the basic functionalities expected from statically-typed quasiquotes,
   and can be used for a wide range of tasks, including [multi-stage programming (MSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-stage_programming).
   They support both runtime interpretation, runtime compilation and static code generation.
   For more information, see [[1]](#scala17).

 * **Contextual Quasiquotes [(tutorial)](/doc/tuto/Quasiquotes.md)** 
   push the type-safety guarantees already offered by simple quasiquotes even further,
   making sure that all generated programs are well-scoped in addition to being well-typed.
   While they are slightly less ergonomic than the previous flavor, 
   these quasiquotes are especially well-suited for expressing advanced program transformation algorithms and complicated staging techniques.
   For more information, see [[3]](#popl18).

Both forms of quasiquotes support a flexible pattern-matching syntax 
and facilities to traverse programs recursively while applying transformations.

As a quick reference available to all Squid users, 
we provide a [cheat sheet](doc/reference/Quasiquotes.md) that summarizes the features of each system. Also see the [quasiquotes tutorial](/doc/tuto/Quasiquotes.md).

### Multi-Stage Programming and Quoted Staged Rewriting

Squid fully support the multi-staged programming paradigm (MSP), 
allowing the composition and evaluation of program fragments at runtime
(via runtime compilation or reflective interpretation).

In addition, since Squid provides type-safe code inspection capabilities
(a novelty in the field of statically-typed staging),
it can be used to achieve quoted staged rewriting (QSR) [[2]](#gpce17),
an approach to program optimization that mixes the advantages of user-defined rewrite rules, strategic program transformation and MSP.

### Library-Defined Optimizations

Squid provides tools to create _static optimizers_, 
which are used to optimize _at compile time_ delimited portions of a user's codebase.
Together with quoted staged rewriting, 
this capability allows for quite flexible and safe library-defined optimizations [[2]](#gpce17).

[Click here to learn more about static optimizers.](doc/Transformers.md#static-optimizers)



<a name="transformers"/>

### Program Transformation Support

Squid supports the definition and composition of custom program transformers and transformation strategies.
This is achieved via Scala mixin-composition and quasiquote-based rewriting declarations.
Squid transformers are type-preserving, 
and they make sure that transformed programs remain well-typed and well-scoped.

[Click here to learn more about Squid transformers.](doc/Transformers.md)


<a name="irs"/>

### Intermediate Representations

Squid quasiquotes, and Squid's infrastructure in general, are unique 
in that they are generic in the actual intermediate representation (IR)
used to encode program fragments.
Custom IRs can be implemented and plugged into Squid to gain the high-level, type-safe features offered by Squid. 
This is done by implementing Squid's object algebra interface [[1]](#scala17).

<a name="smacros"/>

### Squid Macros

Squid macros are an experimental type-safe alternative to legacy scala-reflect macros, based on Squid's infrastructure.
The current implementation is a very rough prototype that should not yet be relied upon.

As an example, here is [the short program transformation](#early-example) 
showed at the beginning of this document,
rewritten as a Squid macro:

```scala
@macroDef(Embedding)
def myMacro(pgrm0: Double) = {
  // in this scope, `pgrm0` has type `Code[Double]`
  val pgrm1 = pgrm0 transformWith (new Lowering('MyPhase) with BottomUpTransformer)
  val pgrm2 = pgrm1 rewrite {
    case code"($xs:List[$t]).::($x).head" => x
    case code"(${Const(n)}:Int) + (${Const(m)}:Int)" => Const(n+m)
  }
  pgrm2
}

// the following should appear in a different project:
myMacro(Test.foo(1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Nil) + 1) // expands into `2.toDouble`
```

(Note: the `macroDef` feature currently lives in experimental branch `squid-macros`.)




## Applications of Squid

Squid is new. See the [examples folder](example/src/main/scala/) for examples. A little query compiler built with Squid can be found [here](https://github.com/epfldata/sc-public/tree/master/relation-dsl-squid). Another LINQ-inspired query engine build with Squid can be found [here](https://github.com/epfldata/dbstage).
